# Neural Network Framework
A framework for building custom neural networks.

## Why did you make this?
I made for two reasons:
1. I wanted to build my own neural net from complete scratch with only NumPy. No PyTorch, no TensorFlow. Nothing but NumPy, baby!
2. I wanted to not only build the neural net code from scratch, I wanted to be able to have a way to build any neural network I wanted for any given scenario with the code I wrote.

## TODO:
- Start working on multidimensional implementations
